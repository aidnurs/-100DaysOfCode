## The Rules
  1. I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
  2. I will tweet about my progress every day
  3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
  4. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
  5. I will ask for help when I need it.
