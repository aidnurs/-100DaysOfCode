<<<<<<< 04bb2a1974802b79b6213b05bd66a566a8c85286
### Day 0: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: worked on Random Quote Machine | [github](https://github.com/aidnurs/RandomQuoteMachine)

**Thoughts:** Cheated with this project, made an array with quotes. 

**TODO:**
- [ ] Quotes should be random, not from an array
- [ ] Style

### Day 1: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: made Wikipedia Viewer - it can search for users input and open a random article.| [github](https://github.com/aidnurs/WikipediaViewer) + BasicAlgorithmScripting from FCC

**Thoughts:** Main problem was with searching engine, but made it. Page has no style, pure Javascript

**TODO:** 
- [ ] use wiki API
- [ ] Style


### Day 2: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: tried to make weather webpage, made JS30 Day1 exercise.

**Thoughts:** Tried to start with back-end, but still need a lot of praxis with front-end. Not satisfied

**TODO:** 
- [ ] learn how to use API

### Day 3: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made an animated clocks(project D2/#JS30) + Algorithms from FCC

**Thoughts:** I thought JS30 projects are too hard for me, but found them very intersting and not so hard, because they're written with pure Javascript and some style rules.


### Day 4: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Pop-Up Penguin Game(idea from Coder) with pure Javascript. | [github](https://github.com/aidnurs/penguins)

**Thoughts:** Coded all day. Feel the progress and you can see it from my .js code. There is only Javascript, nothing else! 

### Day 5: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: D3/#JS30 +  completed an assignment of week 1 on coursera( Full-Stack second course)

**Thoughts:** this course is catastrophic, because everythins is into chaos.

### Day 6: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: D4/#JS30 + exercises from full-stack course on coursera

**Thoughts:** coded all day, but don't feel satisfaction, because improved old projects and learned new stuff (STUCK)

### Day 7: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: made a mondrian painting webpage | [github](https://github.com/aidnurs/Mondrian)
