### Day 14: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: finished basic FCC algorithms + #dailycssimages + D6/#JS30

### Day 14: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: worked on simple jsCalculator(from FCC)+D5/#JS30+algorithms

### Day 12: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: worked with nodejs, just playing with it and trying different commands + still doing algorithms from FCC

### Day 11: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: working on TwitchTV + basic algorithms from FCC + learnyounode exercises

### Day 6: August 12, 2017

### Day 3: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made an animated clocks(project D2/#JS30) + Algorithms from FCC
